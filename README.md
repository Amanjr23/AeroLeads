linkedin-scraper/ — code + small demo to scrape ~20 public LinkedIn profile pages and export CSV.

autodialer-rails/ — a small Rails app (API + simple UI) that uploads a list of phone numbers, triggers calls using Twilio (or Twilio test), logs results, and exposes an AI prompt to make calls.

blog-generator/ — a tiny integration that generates 10 programming articles (from an AI API) and adds them to the Rails app under /blog (or as a separate static site).
